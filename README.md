## Translations

## Limitations

- ‚ùå Crawl websites with Cloudflare anti-bot features.
  - Sites such as mangalivre won't be crawled for the time being.
- ‚ùå Read series through site.
  - It will only redirect the user to a site with said series.
- ‚ùå Update DB daily.
  - We are deciding if this is viable right now, but as it is, it will hinder our progress, so we will postpone this feature.
  - Maybe this will be possible since we discovered a way to request multiple pages at once.
