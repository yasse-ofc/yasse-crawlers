## Goals and Limitations

✅ means done.

🚧 means doing.

❌ means won't do.

&nbsp;

### [Project Related]

- 🚧 Adopt micro commits strategy.
  - Commit for atomic changes so that errors and bugs can be resolved faster.
- 🚧 Integrate backend and frontend.
- 🚧 Separate app in 3 Docker containers: one for the DB, one for the API and one for the crawlers.
- 🚧 Creating an RESTful API using Express so the user can read from DB without having access to it.

&nbsp;

### [Proxy Related]

- ✅ Use proxies.
- ✅ Creating a proxy pool with auto renew.

&nbsp;

### [Crawler Related]

- 🚧 Create crawlers for the following sites:
  - ✅ [BRMangas](https://brmangas.net).
  - ✅ [Manganato](https://manganato.com/).
- ✅ Send multiple requests at once.
- ✅ Using Puppeteer for JS Rendering.
- ✅ Created list of relevant sites to use.
- 🚧 Change crawler structure to adopt crawlee.
- 🚧 Creating crawlers for a lot of sites.

&nbsp;

### [DB Related]

- ✅ Created DB (MongoDB).
- 🚧 Create backup DB.
- 🚧 Update DB on demand.

&nbsp;

### [Frontend Related]

- 🚧 Create search bar to take user input.
- 🚧 Creating frontend for the site using React.
- 🚧 Create responsive dropdown menu for series type selection.

&nbsp;

### [Limitations]

- ❌ Crawl websites with Cloudflare anti-bot features.
  - Sites such as mangalivre won't be crawled for the time being.
- ❌ Read series through site.
  - It will only redirect the user to a site with said series.
- ❌ Update DB daily.
  - We are deciding if this is viable right now, but as it is, it will hinder our progress, so we will postpone this feature.
  - Maybe this will be possible since we discovered a way to request multiple pages at once.

## Problems Encountered

### Problems

1. Updating DB daily;
2. Updating DB without reconstructing it from scratch;

Possible Solutions:

1. Make the update process faster and less resource-heavy;
2. Only update series that changed values;

### Solved Problems

1. Only update DB after going through every series in a site;
2. Create proxy pool with auto renew;

Solutions:

1. Update for every visited page in the site;
2. Use Webshare builtin proxy renewing tool;
